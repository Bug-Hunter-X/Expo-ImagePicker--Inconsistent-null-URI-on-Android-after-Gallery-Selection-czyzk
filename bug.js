This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library in conjunction with a custom camera component.  The issue is that after selecting an image from the device's gallery, the image URI is sometimes undefined or null, causing the app to crash or display an error.  This happens inconsistently, making it difficult to debug. The code below attempts to handle the case of a null URI, but does not always work.  The problem appears specific to certain Android devices and may be related to asynchronous operations within the ImagePicker library.
